                Our method of roasting coffee is on a traditional cast iron coffee roaster built in 1930s This is
                not the most efficient way of roasting coffee; but it is gentle, it takes time and it takes the
                human touch. Throughout the coffee industry large & small, this method is regarded by all, to be the
                best way of roasting. Bringing out wonderful tastes and flavours from each and every coffee bean. We
                roast only high grown, Arabica green beans .
